Blog: Understanding the Difference Between Document and Window Objects in JavaScript

1. The Window Object:
The window object is a global object in the browser environment. It represents the entire browser window
or tab and serves as the global context for JavaScript code running in that window. Here are some key 
aspects of the window object:

Global Scope: Variables and functions declared without a specific scope are attached to the window object.

Browser Properties: The window object provides access to various properties related to the browser, such as
window.innerWidth and window.innerHeight for the viewport dimensions.

2. The Document Object:
The document object is a part of the window object and represents the HTML document displayed in the browser.
It provides an interface to interact with the content of the web page. Key features of the document object
include:

DOM Manipulation: The document object allows developers to access and manipulate elements on the web page.
Common tasks include selecting elements, modifying content, and changing styles.

Events: The document object is involved in handling various events, such as click events, keypress events,
and more. Event listeners can be attached to specific elements in the document.

Key Differences:

Scope:
The window object represents the global context and includes variables and functions that are globally accessible.
The document object is a subset of the window object, specifically focusing on the content and structure of the
HTML document.

Functionality:
The window object deals with properties and methods related to the browser window, global functions, and timing events.
The document object is concerned with manipulating the DOM, handling events within the document,
and interacting with HTML elements.

Hierarchy:
The window object encapsulates the entire browser environment.
The document object is nested within the window object and focuses on the content within a specific HTML document.

Conclusion:
In summary, while the window object provides a global context for JavaScript code and manages browser-related
properties, the document object is specifically tailored for interacting with and manipulating the content of
the HTML document. Understanding the roles and distinctions between these two objects is crucial for effective
web development and DOM manipulation.
